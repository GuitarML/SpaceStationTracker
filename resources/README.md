# Resources

This folder contains resources used to develop the ISS Tracker.
It includes png images, which were then converted to c code.
There are several images that are unused, including a smaller
ISS icon, and a double wide world map with the polar regions removed.
There is also a Google Colab script that I used to generate the 
worldmap images using the python Basemap module. 

These files are not used when compiling the ISS_Tracker app.
